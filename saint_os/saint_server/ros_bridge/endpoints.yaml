# ROS Bridge Endpoint Definitions
#
# Each endpoint defines a unified path that supports both subscribe (state) and publish (command).
# The bridge automatically generates serializers using ROS message introspection.
#
# To add a new endpoint:
#   1. Define your .msg files in saint_os/msg/
#   2. Add an entry here
#   3. Rebuild the ROS package (colcon build)
#
# Format:
#   /path/to/endpoint:
#     state_type: package/msg/MessageType    # For subscribing (optional)
#     command_type: package/msg/MessageType  # For publishing (optional)
#     state_qos: state|command               # QoS profile (default: state)
#     command_qos: state|command             # QoS profile (default: command)
